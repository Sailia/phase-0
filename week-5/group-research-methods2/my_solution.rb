# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented

#I used .each do for both the array and the hash.

# Teach your accountability group how to use the methods

# The difference was that you can use two variables when using .each on the hash. The hash portion was definitely harder as I had to return an array. But just creating an empty array and appending the key to the new array helped.

# Share any tricks you used to find and decipher the Ruby Docs

# Checking Ruby Docs for methods on the array page and the hash page showed me what methods can be applied. I basically went through each of the examples on those pages that made the most sense to me.

end


def my_hash_sorting_method(hash)
  hash.sort_by { |pet, age| age }
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented. => I used
# .sort_by to sort the arrays and hashes in 'alphabetical' order -
# i.e., for an array, numbers get returned before letters, capital
# letters come before lowercase, a is lower than b, etc. For a hash,
# the default is to sort by value, low to high, then return arrays
# of key/value pairs organized accordingly. I added .to_s to the array
# sorting method so that it would consider all the elements as strings
# when it sorts them.

pushed an array to another array.

  We implemented the my_array_splitting_method and the
  my_hash_splitting_method in order to take information out of arrays and sort
  or organize them into different arrays based on data type or value. These
  methods could be altered to sort arrays based on variety of different factors
  .
  my_array_splitting_method takes the input of an array containing  a variety
  of data types and separates it into an array containing a sub-array of all
  the integer elements , and a sub-array with elements of all other data types.
  In order to run this method, simply call my_array_splitting_method on a new line in Ruby with the array that you want to sort in the argument.
  "my_array_splitting_method" performs the following:
  1)  It make new array called output_array to hold a copy of the input to
  make sure that original array is not changed, because it is a non-
  destructive method.
  1.a) "output_array" contains 2 sub-arrays.  The first sub-array is at index
  zero, and the second sub-array is at index 1.
  2)  Next, it goes through each element and checks if it is an integer.
  3)  IF the element is an integer, the method copies this element into
  the sub-array at index zero of "output_array".
  4)  IF element is NOT an integer the method copies this element into
  the sub-array at index 1 of "output_array".
  5)  Lastly, "my_array_splitting_method" returns the output_array.
  "my_hash_splitting_method" takes the input of a hash containing key/value
  pairs of a pet's name and age, and sorts the pairs into an output array based
   on the age values. In order to run this method, simply call my_hash_splitting_method on a new line in Ruby with the array that you want to sort and the age that you want to sort by in the argument.
   "my_hash_splitting_method" performs the following:
  1)  It makes new array called all_pets_array to hold a copy of the input to
  make sure that original hash is not changed, because it is a non-
  destructive method.
  1.a) "all_pets_array" contains 2 sub-arrays.  The first sub-array is at index
  zero, and the second sub-array is at index 1.
  2)  Next, it goes through each element and checks if the age value for the key/value pair is less than the given age argument.
  3)  IF the age value of the key/value pair is less than the given age argument for the method, the method copies this pair into
  the sub-array at index zero of "all_pets_array".
  4)  Otherwise (Else) the method copies this key/value pair into
  the sub-array at index 1 of "all_pets_array".
  5)  Lastly, "my_hash_splitting_method" returns the all_pets_array.

TOOLS FOR NAVIGATING THE RUBY DOCS:
  1) Break down the problem into as many small steps or processes as possible in your Pseudocode.
  2) Step by step, move through your Pseudocode workflow and create the code for each process if you're able to do so.
  3) When you get stuck on a particular process, research the classes or built-in Ruby methods that might be helpful in solving it.
  4) When you come across a method that you think will be useful in your program, try experimenting with it in the terminal, using irb or the ruby interpreter. If it does not work as you expected, move onto step 5. If it does function and achieves the desired goal, move on to the next step in you pseudocode and begin again at step 3.
  5) Search the Ruby docs (http://ruby-doc.org/) for the term or related terms for the method you want to learn more about, and read through the description and follow along with the example code that is provided.
