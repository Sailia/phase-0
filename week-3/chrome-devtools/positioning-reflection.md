#How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

There's a HTML section and a CSS section when you inspect elements in a browser. Chrome DevTools helps you format/position elements by changing the arrangement of images and text. Example, if you want to change the colour of an image, you can select the div thats focused on that image, and chage the back-ground colour to any hex colour or name.

#How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

By putting in the width and height of the element, for example: width: 5em; or height: 10px;.

#What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Static - Is the default value that CSS chooses to be in. The elements are rendered in order, as they appear in the document flow.

Fixed - Do not leave space for the element. Instead, position it at a specified position relative to the screen's viewport and don't move it when scrolled. When printing, position it at that fixed position on every page.

Relative - This keyword lays out all elements as though the element were not positioned, and then adjust the element's position, without changing layout (and thus leaving a gap for the element where it would have been had it not been positioned). The effect of position:relative on table-*-group, table-row, table-column, table-cell, and table-caption elements is undefined

Absolute - an element that is positioned absolutely is taken out of the flow and thus takes up no space when placing other elements. The absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor. If a positioned ancestor doesn't exist, the initial container is used.

#What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?

Padding surrounds the content in a webpage, so your content can extend onto the padding. The border surrounds the padding. The margin surrounds the border and its the most outer portion of the box-size. If an image is put in a margin, it will be right on the edge of the screen.

#What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I think the whole positioning aspect was really challenging as I didn't fully comprehend what I was doing, and it was more of me playing around with the positioning tools to really get what was happening. I think when I put my personality into something like this, its quite frustrating when I'm not translating well enough.I think I still haven't gotten it completely down, but I knew it was all a matter of going back to the drawing board a couple of times. Thats the process when something doesn't work. Try a different approach. I don't have strong feelings towards this challenge. Just a step that needed to be taken in order to fufill an idea.
