What does puts do?

Prints a string on the next line.

What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a Fixnum, and a whole number. A float is a decimal.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

When dividing integers, Ruby will not return the remainder but will return an integer that has been rounded up. Dividing a float will give an accurate answer (like a calculator).

``` ruby
Hours in a year:
irb(main):001:0> 24 * 365
=> 8760

Minutes in a decade:
irb(main):002:0> 60 * 24 * 365 * 10
=> 5256000


How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Pretty much like a calculator except for division and modulus.

What is the difference between integers and floats?

Integers are whole numbers and floats are decimals.

What is the difference between integer and float division?

An integer cannot be divided evenly, and will always be rounded up. To get an accurate answer, at least one of the numbers being divided needs to be a float (a decimal) in order to get an accurate decimal answer.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings can be any character within single or double quotes and can be used to print information. You can use them in conditional statements or assign them to a variable. Theres many things you can use strings for.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Information can be assigned to variables to shorten lines of code. For example, if you have a long equation that you will reference in your code, you don't want to write out the equation over and over again. Assigning it to a variable eliminates that burden.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

It definitely was a review of the basics.
