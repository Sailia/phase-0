Explain why this relationship is a one-to-one to the best of your ability.

Two tables that have a one-to-one relationship must have one commonality in order to share an id.


What is a one-to-one database?

Two tables that have a one-to-one relationship must have one commonality in order to share an id.
for example, a book is published by one company and only that one company has published that book.

When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

The easter bunny is associated with one holiday.

What is a many-to-many database?

A many-to-many relationship contains multiple instances in which both sides of the relationship have more than one commonality.

When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

Each order can contain multiple items and each item can contain multiple orders.

What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?

Its confusing to know how to implement the many to many method in real life. But hopefully acquiring confidence in this field can help utilise the tools when neccessary.
