# Release 4:

# refactor this code to move method assignments to attr_ attributes. Like we did with age. Let's pare down the superfluous code.

# Your Code Here:

class Profile
# first let's finish refactoring this code
# note that there is a way to add all of the variables like :age on one line, how would we do that?
  attr_accessor :age, :name, :occupation

    puts
    puts "name: #{@name}"
    puts
    puts "occupation: #{@occupation}"
    puts
