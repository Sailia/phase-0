#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

We want to use the website Github to create a file, and link it to our local computer. To do that, we must first create a file also known as a repository. We create that file by going to our profile page on Github.com. You'll see a tab with the name repositories, click that, then the green button which says new. Name the file under Repository name, choose public, check the box which says Initialize this repository with a README, then the drop down to select MIT licence. You have now created a repository. To copy it into your computer so that you can implement changes to the file, you must copy the URL on the bottom right. Then head into your Terminal and type git clone and paste the link. It has been copied!

#Describe what open source means.

Open source means when a developer(s) have a program out, they allow users to access the code behind the program for free. Its based on a non-profit community that designs out of the good of their hearts and have a desire to contribute to a meaningful product.

#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

It feels great because the people who decide that their product should be open source are the ones who truly believe in making a great product through improvments from the community and are not doing it for profit. At the same time its kind of sad when their product is taken by users who are looking to make a profit by making a few changes to their original code. Linux was one of them, where its source code was used by Apple.

#Assess the importance of using licenses.

Its important to have source code licenced by the owners otherwise others would have it licenced under their names and have the rights over the material. They may want to make money off of it and that may not be the original creators intention.

#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

The process of creating branches, modifying files and pushing to github helped me solidify my knowledge in this process. It also helps to write down each git command to easily refer to ;) The steps was what I struggled with at first, but that soon went away as I kept rmdir's and mkdir's.

#Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The following helped me with one of the issues I was facing. I didn't refer to the entire page: https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/
