# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
##### I pretty much learned about Meditation, Habits, Getting into the Zone, Flow and Time Boxing. I learned that with meditation, you don't have to be someone that chants OM and reach nirvana, but more about giving your mind a break from the noise outside. I downloaded a few apps for meditation. I loved the habits video and the article on counter-intuitive productivity. They were my favourite because they addressed the issues I currently have with myself in getting things done.

Time Boxing is where you set a time on a project that will be worked on. The goal is to roughly calculate how long it would take for a project to get done or at least get some productivity flowing within a set time. It will definitely apply to our peer pairing sessions in Phase 0 as we only have 45 mins to work together. It will also help me when I plan on working on solo challenges.

I don't really have good time management skills. I left my job where I managed a lot, but since leaving I've been slacking a little. Its time to get back to managing time for myself! My current strategy is to set reminders at certain times throughout the day that help me stay on track on what needs to get done next. It works ok. Sometimes I'm working on something that takes a little longer than expected which throws my schedule off track but I guess that happens...

I am going to employ meditation. I really need to get back into the swing of things by getting up early in the morning. I'd like to meditate at least ten mins every morning before I start the day. Will use the meditation app for that. I'm going to apply tiny habits in which the lecturer was saying how you can apply a "when I do this, then I will do this" mentality. For example, I want to wash my face on time every night, so I will set a tiny habit by stating that "when I get in the door, I will wash my face". I add a habit that I want to a current habit that I already have. Thats genius. I will use this in Phase 0 by stating that "when I am done with breakfast, I will study for three hours using my pomodoro app".

I will try to employ these time management skills as I think they are vital to my style of living. I need to be diligent in sticking with that goal and not to be hard on myself if I miss some days, as long as I keep it up. They're tiny anyway.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
##### A shell is the interface where the user can give commands to the operating system. Bash is the interpreter for the operating system. When a user types a command in terminal, bash takes that command and interprets that command into a language the system can somehow "understand" and execute.

The challenges I faced were mostly the popd and pushd commands as I kept getting confused regarding the path I was on, and what command was doing what... I will need more experience with that one.

I used most of the commands successfully. Whats funny was in the crash course, the fourth page was about the command pwd, which was the first assigned material that didn't work.  It kept giving me an error. The other commands were understandable and flowed pretty well through those. Its kind of crazy when you learn certain commands such as pipes and redirection, and how exciting it is to learn these shortcuts to your files as opposed to clicking around!

The important/useful commands that are useful to me right now would be the "cd .." and "ls" commands. Because I'm new to all this, it helps me find my place in the files. I will practice more in working in other areas and visualise more on where I am in the system.

pwd (print working directory) - It displays the directory/path you are currently in.

ls - shows the list of files in that directory/folder

mv - move a file to another folder/directory

cd - Change to another directory

. ./ - Move up a directory

touch - Create a new file

mkdir - Make a new directory

less - Allows you to look at a file page by page

rmdir - Remove/delete a directory

rm - Remove files, directories, objects etc. Any file needing to be removed.

help - honestly, I only remember learning about apropos in the crash course. But I searched online and yeah, it does the same thing in which you can get help on only build in bash commands.
