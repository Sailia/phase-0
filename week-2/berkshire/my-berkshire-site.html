<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was really fun to understand someone else's code on the site because it helped me realise the little details a more through the difference from my code to theirs. It made me appreciate the opportunity to write code through someone else's perspective. It helped me learn so much more.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

It wasn't that big of a difference in my opinion; just a few tiny changes.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I learned that content is more important to put down, and there is still quite a bit to accomplish with that. Such as adding links, showing the importance of the wording through bold/italic fonts and a new one I learned "<small>" to put in the footer.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

The bad thing about HTML is that its very limiting in terms of styles. Its hard to get creative.The good thing about that is you get inspired to add more once the main content is down so its a great stepping stone to making your content look beautiful.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

When starting out, it best to put in the mandatory tags such as <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <title> and <body>. That way you have your foundation guidelines down before adding sweet content.
