What is a wireframe?

Wireframing is the UX designers' fastest approach to prototyping their website. More particularly, anybody can use wireframing as an outline of their website.

What are the benefits of wireframing?

It helps to wireframe by implementing the structure of a website the fastest way possible. It's like drawing a brainstorm, where the links are the branches to another page. But all in all its the easiest way to get your ideas down really fast before any of the sweet details are added.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I used gomockingbird.com to wireframe. It was my favourite thing to do so far as it was not as difficult to visualise the end result. It made ideas seem more realistic when playing around with the application.

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I revised it a few times because I wanted my site to be as clean and simple as possible, like a french clothing website..

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I had trouble understanding the material in 2.4 because in release 1, I didn't know where to save the wireframe-index file, and in release 2 I wasn't entirely sure where to put the wire-frame-index.png file. It needs to be clearer, such as bullet points on release 3.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I enjoyed making the wireframe because I was excited to see my site up! I found the whole "trying to make sure which file, repo, directory to save to" tedious because I know that once I save to a wrong file, it'll take me a while to fix as everything is still raw for me.
